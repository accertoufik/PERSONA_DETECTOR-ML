Student Persona Clustering Web App (CSV Upload Version)This project converts the K-Means clustering model from your ML_Project.ipynb notebook into a full-stack web application.This version allows you to upload your Studentdata.csv file directly, and the backend will run the entire cleaning, training, and prediction pipeline on the fly, returning a table of the results.How It WorksFrontend (index.html): You select your Studentdata.csv file using the upload form and click "Process".Backend (app.py): The Flask server receives this file at the /upload_and_process endpoint. It then:Loads the CSV into a pandas DataFrame.Performs all 8 of your data cleaning functions.Calculates the medians for imputation from the uploaded file.Initializes, fits, and transforms the data with a new StandardScaler.Initializes, fits, and predicts with a new KMeans model.Adds the resulting 'Cluster' and 'Persona' columns to the cleaned DataFrame.Returns the entire processed DataFrame as a JSON string.Frontend (index.html): The JavaScript receives this JSON, parses it, and dynamically builds an HTML table to display all the students and their predicted personas.How to Run Locally in VS CodeThis setup is now simpler as there is no separate training step.Your Folder StructureYour ML_Project folder in VS Code should look like this:ML_Project/
├── app.py                 # The Flask backend
├── index.html             # The HTML frontend
├── requirements.txt       # Python libraries
├── README.md              # These instructions
|
└── Studentdata.csv        # Your original data file (for testing)
Step 1: Create Folder and Add FilesOn your computer, find or create your ML_Project folder.Save all the files I provided (app.py, index.html, requirements.txt, and this README.md) into this folder.Copy your Studentdata.csv file into this folder so you have it ready to upload.Step 2: Open in VS Code & Install LibrariesOpen VS Code.Go to "File" > "Open Folder..." and select your ML_Project folder.Open a new terminal in VS Code ("Terminal" > "New Terminal").Create a Python virtual environment:python -m venv venv
Activate the environment:macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activateWindows (Command Prompt): venv\Scripts\activateWindows (PowerShell): venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1Install the required libraries:pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Run the Backend (Flask)In your VS Code terminal (with the venv activated), run the Flask server:python app.py
Your terminal will show that the backend is running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.Step 4: Run the Frontend (HTML)Make sure you have the "Live Server" extension installed in VS Code.In the VS Code file explorer, right-click on index.html.Select "Open with Live Server".Your browser will open. Click "Choose file", select your Studentdata.csv file from the ML_Project folder, and click "Process File and Predict Personas".You will see a loading spinner, and then the full results table will appear on the page.How to Deploy to the WebCreate a Procfile: In your ML_Project folder, create a new file named Procfile (with no extension) and add: web: gunicorn app:appPush to GitHub: Push your entire folder to a new GitHub repository.Deploy Backend on Render: Connect your GitHub repo to a new "Web Service" on Render.com. Use gunicorn app:app as the start command.Deploy Frontend on Netlify: Connect the same repo to a new site on Netlify.Connect Frontend to Backend: Edit index.html (around line 161), change const apiUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload_and_process'; to your live Render URL, and push the change to GitHub.
